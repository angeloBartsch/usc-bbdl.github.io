	  	<b>Rehabilitation Of Upper Extremity Function In Stroke</b><br>
		Andrew Erwin, Angelo Bartsch Jimenez, Mohammad Hesam Azadjou, Grace Niyo, Lama Almofeez<br>
		We are investigating the contributions of reticulospinal and corticospinal tracts to motor impairment and recovery after stroke. Our objective is to develop valid neurophysiological assays to characterize mechanisms of motor impairment at the level of the reticulospinal tract-thereby opening up novel assessment and rehabilitation approaches.<br>

	  	<b>Feasibility theory</b><br>
		Brian Cohn<br>
		How do we learn to manipulate forces in spite of having squishy tendon-driven limbs? We are reverse engineering how the mechanics of biology define the dimensionality of control. We achieve this with robotic and cadaveric studies, pulling on tendons, and identifying how muscle forces contribute to fingertip forces, and by constructing constraint-based simulations.<br>

	  	<b>Analysis of different movement trajectories</b> <br>
		Daniel Hagen<br>
		When it comes to free throws, what's the difference between a good shot, and a good looking shot? We are delving into the high dimensionality surrounding the many ways that an arm can shoot a basketball, and are uncovering the limitations of muscle control for different trajectories.<br>

		<b>Squishy-Meta</b><br>
		Brian Cohn, Kian Jalaleddini<br>
		How is the control of squishy, non-linear robots different than the control of stiff, revolute robots? Do the algorithms for controlling each work when applied to the other?<br>
